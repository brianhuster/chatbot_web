# Running the Chat Application

This guide will help you run the chat application contained in the `index.html` file.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- A local web server (like Python's SimpleHTTPServer, Node's http-server, etc.). Or you can use Live Server feature from VSCode
- An API key from OpenAI for API access. Or a laptop/PC with >8GB RAM

## Start the app using OpenAI API

1. **Set up the API key**

Open the `index.html` file and locate the following line:

```html
const chatGPTKey = 'sk-'; // Paste the API key here
```

Replace `'sk-*****'` with your actual OpenAI GPT-3 API key.

2. **Start the local server**

Navigate to the directory containing `index.html` and start your local server. For example, if you're using Python's SimpleHTTPServer, you can start it with the command:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

If you're using Node's http-server, you can start it with the command:

```bash
http-server
```

3. **Access the application**

Open your web browser and navigate to localhost on the port your server is running. For example, if your server is running on port 8000, you would navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

4. **Interact with the chat application**

You should now see the chat interface in your browser. You can type messages into the input field and press "Send" to interact with the chatbot.

Please note that this is a simple setup meant for local development and testing. It is not suitable for a production environment.

## Start the app using Local API

1. **Download model**

Create a folder named `models`, then download `mistral-7b-openorca.Q4_0.gguf` from here <https://huggingface.co/Open-Orca/Mistral-7B-OpenOrca> and put into the `models` folder. You can choose any other gguf models from huggingface instead of mistral-7b-openorca.Q4_0.gguf, as long as it is not too heavy to run on your computer. 

Or you can download a model from here https://terabox.com/s/1M2Zx-OJFzXHg9K-uMHo36A. All of them are tested, and can be run on such a low-end computer with CPU intel core i5, RAM 8GB and no NVIDIA GPU. 

2. **Install llama_cpp Python**

Follow the guide here to install llama_cpp Python <https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python>

3. **Run local OpenAI server**

Run the following script to run an OpenAI API server locally. The server should run at port 8000

```bash
python3 -m llama_cpp.server --model "./models/{{model_file_name}}" --chat_format chatml --n_gpu_layers 1
```

4. **Update chat application code**

Open the `index.html` file and locate the following line

```html
  // Real GPT
  // const OPEN_AI_ENDPOINT = 'https://api.openai.com/v1' // Comment this line

  // Security, do not deploy this in production
  const chatGPTKey = 'sk-*****'; // Create an API key from here

  // Local GPT
  const OPEN_AI_ENDPOINT = 'http://localhost:8000/v1' // Uncomment this line
```

Run the application again. It should use localhost for local API inteference.
